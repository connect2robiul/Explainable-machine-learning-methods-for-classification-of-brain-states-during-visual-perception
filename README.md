# Explainable Machine Learning Methods for Classification of Brain States during Visual Perception 

## Abstract: 

The aim of this work is to find a good mathematical model for the classification of brain states during visual perception with a focus on the interpretability of the results. To achieve it, we use the deep learning models with different activation functions and optimization methods for their comparison and find the best model for the considered dataset of 31 EEG channels trials. To estimate the influence of different features on the classification process and make the method more interpretable, we use the SHAP library technique. We find that the best optimization method is Adagrad and the worst one is FTRL. In addition, we find that only Adagrad works well for both linear and tangent models. The results could be useful for EEG-based brainâ€“computer interfaces (BCIs) in part for choosing the appropriate machine learning methods and features for the correct training of the BCI intelligent system.
